  'cookingtimers': `<h1>Cooking timers</h1> <p>over the past few years i've tried to inch my way from designing, to web development, to programming. this is a simple program I built with react.js. you can set (and delete) timers. you can also name the timers. <a href="http://cooking-timers.net" target="_blank">cookingtimers.net</a></p> <img class="border" src="/img/cookingtimers.gif" />`,
  'wikikids': `<h1>Wikipedia for kids</h1>   <p>this was a side project i worked on for a few weeks, starting from the question: what's one way to make wikipedia more accessible for younger learners? i imagined a simple workflow where wikipedia editors could create summaries of articles, using existing images and text. then on the mobile website there would be a tab to access these summaries. thanks to ed sanders and jon robson for helping me out with this.</p>   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WvWXke-SeOQ?controls=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>`,
