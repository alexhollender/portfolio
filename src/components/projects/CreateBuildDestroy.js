    <h1>Create Build Destroy</h1>
    <p className="text-block">In 2006, my cousin Tyler started designing graphics and silk-screening them onto shirts. His designs were colorful and often based on rap lyrics. He called the project <i>Create Clothing</i>. Around 2007 I asked if I could help him out. I was interested in the clothing business (partly inspired by another t-shirt company called <i>LOLA</i>) and thought it would be a cool experience to try and sell the t-shirts to stores (i.e. wholesale), and also find a professional screen printer to make the shirts. Over the next few years the graphics and brand evolved, and my friends Jesse and Jordan joined in to help out. I was mainly still responsible for sales and production. Our t-shirts were sold in stores around the US, and eventually some in Europe and Scandinavia too (with the help of a showroom in Milan, and one in Denmark). We made stickers, matchbooks, and hats. We threw a bunch of parties. We had a lot of photoshoots. We had a blog that I posted on religiously. Over time I learned how to use Photoshop and Illustrator, and started making our product catalogs, other sales and marketing material, and various graphics/event fliers/etc. I also learned some HTML and CSS (thanks PJ), and managed our website. Back then I never saw myself as a designer, or even really as a creative person. But working on this project gave me a lot of confidence towards expressing myself. I am thankful to Tyler, Jordan, and Jesse for such a fun & educational journey â˜º</p>
