    <h1>AltSchool</h1>
    <p className="text-block">In January 2015 I moved to San Francisco to work for <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/07/altschools-disrupted-education" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">AltSchool</a>, an education technology company. They had raised over a hundred million dollars, opened a few micro/lab schools, and were aiming to reimagine K–8 education with a focus on interdisciplinary, personalized, project-based learning. I was the second designer to join. I mainly worked as a product designer on the learning management platform, which helped teachers plan, assign, and assess more personalized learning experiences for their students. There was a student-facing part of the experience, with a daily "playlist" of assignments, goals, a portfolio of work, etc., and a parent portal as well, where parents could participate in their child's eudcation. I learned a lot about education, America's public school system, and working with kids (I did a bit of volunteer teaching). Along the way I got to work on a bunch of other fun things as well like the 8th grade diplomas, habit cards to help younger learners learn important life skills, branding & marketing stuff, and more.</p>
